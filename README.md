📌 Comprehensive Recommendation Systems Using Sklearn
📖 Project Overview

This project is a part of guided project done at cognitive class, presents an end-to-end implementation of three major types of recommendation systems using Python. The project focuses on understanding the working principles, strengths, and limitations of different recommendation techniques through practical experimentation and analysis.

The goal is to build scalable and interpretable recommendation models that can be applied to real-world personalization problems.

🔍 Types of Recommendation Systems Implemented

1️⃣ Popularity-based recommendations

Recommends items based on overall popularity

Does not require user-specific preferences

Serves as a strong baseline for comparison


2️⃣ Content-based recommendation

Recommends items based on similarity between item features and user profiles

Personalized and independent of other users

3️⃣ Collaborative filtering

Generates recommendations using user–item interaction patterns

Exploits collective user behavior

🛠️ Technologies & Libraries Used

Python

Pandas

NumPy

Scikit-learn

Cosine Similarity & Matrix-based Methods

📊 Key Features

Clean and modular Python implementation

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand user–item interactions

Comparative analysis of different recommendation techniques

🎯 Applications

E-commerce recommendation engines

Movie and content recommendation platforms

Personalized user experience systems
